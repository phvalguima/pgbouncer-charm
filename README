# Overview

PgBouncer is a lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL.


# Installation

Ro deploy you'll need at a minimum: a cloud environment, a working Juju
installation, and a successful bootstrap. Please refer to the
[Juju Getting Started](https://juju.ubuntu.com/docs/getting-started.html)
documentation before continuing.

Once bootstrapped, deploy the PgBouncer charm:

    juju deploy --repository=~/juju-charms/ local:precise/pgbouncer

Expose the PgBouncer installation

    juju expose pgbouncer


# Configuration

    juju set pgbouncer max_client_conn=50
